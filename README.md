# minesweeper-graph-traversal
This is a Minesweeper game made using Python. The algorithm used for exploring the board are graph traversal algorithms and currently Breadth-First Search (BFS) is the only one implemented.

## Development notes
- has lots of bugs
- still working on optimization and adding other graph traversal algorithms
- will work on the UI!
